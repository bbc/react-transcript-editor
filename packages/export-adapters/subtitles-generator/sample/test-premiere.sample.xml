<p begin="00:00:13.860" end="00:00:16.650">About ten years ago when I asked a</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.280" end="00:00:19.580">friend to hold a baby dinosaur<br />robot upside down.</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.170" end="00:00:23.390">It was a toy called plea.</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.030" end="00:00:48.260">All It's a super courts are</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.110" end="00:00:51.490">showing off to my friend and I<br />said to hold it, but he'll see</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.220" end="00:00:51.790">what debts.</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.660" end="00:00:56.920">We were watching the theatrics of</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.010" end="00:01:03.730">this robe that struggle and cry<br />out and and after a few The first.</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.570" end="00:01:07.960">After my little and I said o.k.</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.870" end="00:01:08.900">That's enough.</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.220" end="00:01:15.310">Now, let's put him back down and<br />pepper, about to make it.</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.040" end="00:01:20.650">Stop crying and I was kind of a<br />weird experience for me one thing,</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.930" end="00:01:23.750">wasn't the most maternal person at<br />the time.</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.380" end="00:01:27.620">Although, since then I've become a<br />mother and nine months ago.</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.380" end="00:01:31.650">And that is a score when hold them<br />up to now, but my response to this</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.530" end="00:01:36.850">robot was also interesting because<br />I knew exactly how this machine</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.570" end="00:01:37.700">work it.</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.260" end="00:01:38.170">And yet.</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.010" end="00:01:41.840">I still felt compelled to be kind<br />to it.</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.670" end="00:01:46.610">And that observation sparked that<br />curiosity that I spent the decade</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.410" end="00:01:47.710">pursuing it.</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.930" end="00:01:49.740">Why did they comfort this robe.</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.410" end="00:01:56.570">One of the things I discovered was<br />my treatment of this machine was</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.480" end="00:02:00.360">more than just an awkward moment<br />in my living room that in a world</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.210" end="00:02:03.000">were increasingly integrating<br />robots into our lives and things</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.620" end="00:02:07.020">like that might actually have<br />consequences because the first</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.210" end="00:02:09.750">thing that I discovered is that.</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.389" end="00:02:13.760">It's not just me in two thousand</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.680" end="00:02:14.020">seven.</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.760" end="00:02:15.350">The Washington Post reported that</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.160" end="00:02:20.080">the United States military was<br />testing this robot diffused</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.580" end="00:02:20.690">landmines.</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.080" end="00:02:22.510">We workers were shaped like a</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.420" end="00:02:28.110">stick insect would walk around a<br />minefield on its legs and every</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.740" end="00:02:30.100">time he stepped on a mine.</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.560" end="00:02:32.060">One of the legs would blow up</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.900" end="00:02:34.830">would continue on the other legs<br />to block your minds in the colonel</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.730" end="00:02:37.280">was in charge of this testing<br />exercise for calling it off</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.930" end="00:02:41.030">because he says it's too inhumane<br />to watch this damage robot drag</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.940" end="00:02:45.740">itself along What would cause a<br />hardened military officer and</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.610" end="00:02:49.130">someone like myself to have this<br />response to row.</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.600" end="00:02:50.060">But what.</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.600" end="00:02:56.400">Of course for prime for science</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.230" end="00:03:01.440">fiction, pop culture really want<br />to personify these things, but it</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.290" end="00:03:06.090">goes a little bit deeper than that<br />it turns out that we are</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.780" end="00:03:09.870">biologically hard wired to project<br />intent and life onto any movement</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.740" end="00:03:10.480">in a physical space.</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.340" end="00:03:12.810">It seems I promised us people</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.700" end="00:03:15.090">treat all sort of robots like<br />their life.</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.960" end="00:03:18.270">These bomb disposal units get<br />names.</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.690" end="00:03:22.370">They get medals of honour had<br />funeral for them with gun salutes.</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.920" end="00:03:24.950">Research shows that we do this.</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.590" end="00:03:27.250">Even with very simple household</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.930" end="00:03:29.400">robots like the room.</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.770" end="00:03:30.180">A vacuum cleaner.</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.730" end="00:03:35.760">Just a desk that runs around the<br />floor and clean it just the fact</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.670" end="00:03:39.400">that it's moving around on his own<br />will cause people to name the</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.300" end="00:03:42.990">marimba and feel bad for the room.</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.690" end="00:03:45.000">But when he gets stuck under the</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.830" end="00:03:45.100">couch.</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.020" end="00:03:46.560">We can design about specifically</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.230" end="00:03:48.620">to invoke this response using eyes<br />and faces were movement.</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.430" end="00:03:50.290">People are magically<br />subconsciously associate with</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.130" end="00:03:50.740">state of mind.</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.610" end="00:03:51.730">There's an entire body of research</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.630" end="00:03:57.210">called Human robot interaction<br />that really shows how all this</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.000" end="00:03:58.150">works so.</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.780" end="00:03:59.330">For example.</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.160" end="00:04:04.720">Researchers at Stamford University<br />found out that makes people really</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.560" end="00:04:08.350">uncomfortable and asked them to<br />touch her about his private parts</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.110" end="00:04:10.400">from this from any other studies.</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.920" end="00:04:10.700">We know.</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.610" end="00:04:15.320">We know that people respond to the<br />cues given to them by the lifelike</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.100" end="00:04:15.660">machines.</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.320" end="00:04:17.540">Even if they know that they're not</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.269" end="00:04:17.660">real.</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.540" end="00:04:21.930">We're heading towards a world</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.630" end="00:04:25.250">where robots are everywhere about<br />the technology is moving out from</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.100" end="00:04:27.880">behind factory was entering<br />workplaces households and as these</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.670" end="00:04:28.000">machines.</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.880" end="00:04:30.820">They can sense and make a ton of</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.680" end="00:04:35.710">my decisions and learn enter into<br />the shared spaces.</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.280" end="00:04:38.020">I think that maybe the best<br />analogy.</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.960" end="00:04:40.810">We have for this is our<br />relationship with animals.</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.260" end="00:04:46.630">Thousands of years ago, we started<br />to domesticate animals and we</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.920" end="00:04:48.690">train them for work and weaponry<br />and companionship.</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.040" end="00:04:49.540">Throughout history.</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.990" end="00:04:50.580">We've treated.</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.370" end="00:04:53.760">Some animals like tools are the<br />products and other animals.</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.510" end="00:04:57.990">We treated with kindness and given<br />a place in society as our</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.490" end="00:04:58.080">companions.</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.990" end="00:04:59.760">I think it's possible.</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.440" end="00:05:02.340">We might start to integrate<br />Robartes, but similar weights</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.150" end="00:05:03.830">animals are alive.</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.140" end="00:05:05.910">Robert and that.</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.640" end="00:05:08.670">And I can tell you from working.</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.960" end="00:05:11.330">What about the sister were pretty</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.990" end="00:05:12.790">far away from developing robots.</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.610" end="00:05:14.240">They can feel anything there, but</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.120" end="00:05:17.330">we feel for And that matters<br />because if we're trying to</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.260" end="00:05:25.020">integrate robots into the shared<br />spaces need to understand that</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.570" end="00:05:29.070">people treat them differently than<br />other devices that in some cases.</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.940" end="00:05:32.040">For example, the case of a soldier<br />who becomes emotionally attached</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.720" end="00:05:32.690">to the robot.</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.280" end="00:05:34.170">They work.</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.130" end="00:05:39.780">Well, if that can be anything from<br />inefficient to dangerous.</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.580" end="00:05:40.940">But in other cases.</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.320" end="00:05:43.050">It can actually be used for the</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.960" end="00:05:46.600">faster this emotional connection<br />to, but we're really seeing some</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.740" end="00:05:48.080">great use cases.</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.770" end="00:05:50.390">For example, robots working with</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.100" end="00:05:53.100">autistic children to engage them<br />in ways that we haven't seen</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.750" end="00:05:55.310">previously robot's working with<br />teachers to engage kids and</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.950" end="00:05:59.940">learning with new and it's not<br />just for kids early studies show</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.630" end="00:06:03.280">that we can help doctors and<br />patients and health care settings</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.610" end="00:06:06.380">and this is the pirate b. b. c.</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.260" end="00:06:08.950">But it's used in nursing homes</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.410" end="00:06:12.030">with dementia patients has been<br />around for a while I remember</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.180" end="00:06:13.510">years ago.</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.170" end="00:06:15.210">Being a party and telling someone</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.030" end="00:06:20.040">about this throwback and her<br />response was I can't believe we're</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.750" end="00:06:21.750">giving people robots instead of<br />human care.</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.540" end="00:06:25.900">is a really common response and I<br />think it's absolutely correct</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.740" end="00:06:26.910">because that would be terrible.</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.760" end="00:06:28.050">And in this case.</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.930" end="00:06:31.830">It's not with this robot replace<br />it with this robot replaces his</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.310" end="00:06:35.730">animal therapy in context which he<br />was real animals.</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.590" end="00:06:45.110">We can use robots because people<br />consistently treat them like more.</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.040" end="00:06:47.890">More like an animal and have it<br />acknowledging this emotional</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.540" end="00:06:48.490">connection.</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.890" end="00:06:52.390">Robert, can also help us</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.680" end="00:06:53.170">anticipate challenges as these<br />devices.</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.010" end="00:06:58.460">Move into more intimate areas of<br />people's lives and for example is</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.240" end="00:06:58.600">it.</p>

<p begin="00:06:58.600" end="00:07:01.540">If your child's teddy bear robot<br />records private conversations.</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.180" end="00:07:02.490">Is it.</p>

<p begin="00:07:07.440" end="00:07:10.320">That's plus capitalism equals<br />questions around consumer</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.960" end="00:07:13.670">protection and privacy and those<br />aren't the only reason, said her</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.410" end="00:07:17.520">behaviour around these machines<br />could, madam.</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.230" end="00:07:20.130">A few years after that first<br />initial experience.</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.880" end="00:07:23.790">I had with this baby dinosaur<br />robot do workshop with her friend</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.740" end="00:07:24.800">Hannah Scott.</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.230" end="00:07:27.000">Scott, then we took five of these</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.680" end="00:07:29.890">baby dinosaur about we give them.</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.760" end="00:07:31.040">The five teams of people.</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.590" end="00:07:39.520">We had the name them and play with<br />them and them for about an hour.</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.940" end="00:07:44.170">Then we unveiled a him or a<br />hatchet and we told them to</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.080" end="00:07:51.090">torture and kill the row and then<br />this turned out to be a little</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.700" end="00:07:55.290">more dramatic than we expected it<br />to be because none of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.160" end="00:07:57.270">participants wouldn't even so much<br />as straight.</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.900" end="00:07:57.890">A robot.</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.680" end="00:07:59.320">So we had to improvise.</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.900" end="00:08:00.330">End at some point.</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.200" end="00:08:01.080">He said o.k.</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.750" end="00:08:03.220">You can save your team's robot.</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.790" end="00:08:05.240">If you destroy another team throw.</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.140" end="00:08:09.070">I And anyone that didn't work.</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.800" end="00:08:10.060">They couldn't do it.</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.810" end="00:08:12.100">So finally said, We're gonna<br />destroy all the robots are someone</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.010" end="00:08:17.670">takes a hatchet to one of them.</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.420" end="00:08:19.130">This guy stood up and he took the</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.010" end="00:08:20.300">hatchet and the whole room,<br />Winston.</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.120" end="00:08:24.360">See brother had to down on the<br />robot's neck and there was this</p>
