1,"13.02","14.13","There is a day."
2,"13.86","16.65","About ten years ago when I asked a"
3,"16.28","19.58","friend to hold a baby dinosaur
robot upside down."
4,"19.17","23.39","It was a toy called plea."
5,"23.03","48.26","All It's a super courts are"
6,"48.11","51.49","showing off to my friend and I
said to hold it, but he'll see"
7,"51.22","51.79","what debts."
8,"51.66","56.92","We were watching the theatrics of"
9,"56.01","63.73","this robe that struggle and cry
out and and after a few The first."
10,"63.57","67.96","After my little and I said o.k."
11,"67.87","68.9","That's enough."
12,"68.22","75.31","Now, let's put him back down and
pepper, about to make it."
13,"75.04","80.65","Stop crying and I was kind of a
weird experience for me one thing,"
14,"79.93","83.75","wasn't the most maternal person at
the time."
15,"83.38","87.62","Although, since then I've become a
mother and nine months ago."
16,"87.38","91.65","And that is a score when hold them
up to now, but my response to this"
17,"91.53","96.85","robot was also interesting because
I knew exactly how this machine"
18,"96.57","97.7","work it."
19,"97.26","98.17","And yet."
20,"98.01","101.84","I still felt compelled to be kind
to it."
21,"101.67","106.61","And that observation sparked that
curiosity that I spent the decade"
22,"106.41","107.71","pursuing it."
23,"106.93","109.74","Why did they comfort this robe."
24,"109.41","116.57","One of the things I discovered was
my treatment of this machine was"
25,"116.48","120.36","more than just an awkward moment
in my living room that in a world"
26,"120.21","123","were increasingly integrating
robots into our lives and things"
27,"122.62","127.02","like that might actually have
consequences because the first"
28,"126.21","129.75","thing that I discovered is that."
29,"129.39","133.76","It's not just me in two thousand"
30,"133.68","134.02","seven."
31,"133.76","135.35","The Washington Post reported that"
32,"135.16","140.08","the United States military was
testing this robot diffused"
33,"139.58","140.69","landmines."
34,"140.08","142.51","We workers were shaped like a"
35,"142.42","148.11","stick insect would walk around a
minefield on its legs and every"
36,"147.74","150.1","time he stepped on a mine."
37,"149.56","152.06","One of the legs would blow up"
38,"151.9","154.83","would continue on the other legs
to block your minds in the colonel"
39,"154.73","157.28","was in charge of this testing
exercise for calling it off"
40,"156.93","161.03","because he says it's too inhumane
to watch this damage robot drag"
41,"160.94","165.74","itself along What would cause a
hardened military officer and"
42,"165.61","169.13","someone like myself to have this
response to row."
43,"168.6","170.06","But what."
44,"169.6","176.4","Of course for prime for science"
45,"176.23","181.44","fiction, pop culture really want
to personify these things, but it"
46,"181.29","186.09","goes a little bit deeper than that
it turns out that we are"
47,"185.78","189.87","biologically hard wired to project
intent and life onto any movement"
48,"189.74","190.48","in a physical space."
49,"190.34","192.81","It seems I promised us people"
50,"192.7","195.09","treat all sort of robots like
their life."
51,"194.96","198.27","These bomb disposal units get
names."
52,"197.69","202.37","They get medals of honour had
funeral for them with gun salutes."
53,"201.92","204.95","Research shows that we do this."
54,"204.59","207.25","Even with very simple household"
55,"206.93","209.4","robots like the room."
56,"208.77","210.18","A vacuum cleaner."
57,"209.73","215.76","Just a desk that runs around the
floor and clean it just the fact"
58,"215.67","219.4","that it's moving around on his own
will cause people to name the"
59,"219.3","222.99","marimba and feel bad for the room."
60,"222.69","225","But when he gets stuck under the"
61,"224.83","225.1","couch."
62,"225.02","226.56","We can design about specifically"
63,"226.23","228.62","to invoke this response using eyes
and faces were movement."
64,"228.43","230.29","People are magically
subconsciously associate with"
65,"230.13","230.74","state of mind."
66,"230.61","231.73","There's an entire body of research"
67,"231.63","237.21","called Human robot interaction
that really shows how all this"
68,"237","238.15","works so."
69,"237.78","239.33","For example."
70,"239.16","244.72","Researchers at Stamford University
found out that makes people really"
71,"244.56","248.35","uncomfortable and asked them to
touch her about his private parts"
72,"248.11","250.4","from this from any other studies."
73,"249.92","250.7","We know."
74,"250.61","255.32","We know that people respond to the
cues given to them by the lifelike"
75,"255.1","255.66","machines."
76,"255.32","257.54","Even if they know that they're not"
77,"257.27","257.66","real."
78,"257.54","261.93","We're heading towards a world"
79,"261.63","265.25","where robots are everywhere about
the technology is moving out from"
80,"265.1","267.88","behind factory was entering
workplaces households and as these"
81,"267.67","268","machines."
82,"267.88","270.82","They can sense and make a ton of"
83,"270.68","275.71","my decisions and learn enter into
the shared spaces."
84,"275.28","278.02","I think that maybe the best
analogy."
85,"277.96","280.81","We have for this is our
relationship with animals."
86,"280.26","286.63","Thousands of years ago, we started
to domesticate animals and we"
87,"285.92","288.69","train them for work and weaponry
and companionship."
88,"288.04","289.54","Throughout history."
89,"288.99","290.58","We've treated."
90,"290.37","293.76","Some animals like tools are the
products and other animals."
91,"293.51","297.99","We treated with kindness and given
a place in society as our"
92,"297.49","298.08","companions."
93,"297.99","299.76","I think it's possible."
94,"299.44","302.34","We might start to integrate
Robartes, but similar weights"
95,"302.15","303.83","animals are alive."
96,"303.14","305.91","Robert and that."
97,"305.64","308.67","And I can tell you from working."
98,"307.96","311.33","What about the sister were pretty"
99,"310.99","312.79","far away from developing robots."
100,"312.61","314.24","They can feel anything there, but"
101,"314.12","317.33","we feel for And that matters
because if we're trying to"
102,"317.26","325.02","integrate robots into the shared
spaces need to understand that"
103,"324.57","329.07","people treat them differently than
other devices that in some cases."
104,"328.94","332.04","For example, the case of a soldier
who becomes emotionally attached"
105,"331.72","332.69","to the robot."
106,"332.28","334.17","They work."
107,"334.13","339.78","Well, if that can be anything from
inefficient to dangerous."
108,"339.58","340.94","But in other cases."
109,"340.32","343.05","It can actually be used for the"
110,"342.96","346.6","faster this emotional connection
to, but we're really seeing some"
111,"345.74","348.08","great use cases."
112,"347.77","350.39","For example, robots working with"
113,"350.1","353.1","autistic children to engage them
in ways that we haven't seen"
114,"352.75","355.31","previously robot's working with
teachers to engage kids and"
115,"354.95","359.94","learning with new and it's not
just for kids early studies show"
116,"359.63","363.28","that we can help doctors and
patients and health care settings"
117,"362.61","366.38","and this is the pirate b. b. c."
118,"366.26","368.95","But it's used in nursing homes"
119,"368.41","372.03","with dementia patients has been
around for a while I remember"
120,"371.18","373.51","years ago."
121,"373.17","375.21","Being a party and telling someone"
122,"375.03","380.04","about this throwback and her
response was I can't believe we're"
123,"379.75","381.75","giving people robots instead of
human care."
124,"381.54","385.9","is a really common response and I
think it's absolutely correct"
125,"385.74","386.91","because that would be terrible."
126,"386.76","388.05","And in this case."
127,"387.93","391.83","It's not with this robot replace
it with this robot replaces his"
128,"391.31","395.73","animal therapy in context which he
was real animals."
129,"395.59","405.11","We can use robots because people
consistently treat them like more."
130,"405.04","407.89","More like an animal and have it
acknowledging this emotional"
131,"407.54","408.49","connection."
132,"407.89","412.39","Robert, can also help us"
133,"411.68","413.17","anticipate challenges as these
devices."
134,"413.01","418.46","Move into more intimate areas of
people's lives and for example is"
135,"418.24","418.6","it."
136,"418.46","418.81","o.k."
137,"418.6","421.54","If your child's teddy bear robot
records private conversations."
138,"421.18","422.49","Is it."
139,"422.28","422.9","o.k."
140,"422.55","427.78","If your sex robot has compelling
in our purchasers because rope."
141,"427.44","430.32","That's plus capitalism equals
questions around consumer"
142,"429.96","433.67","protection and privacy and those
aren't the only reason, said her"
143,"433.41","437.52","behaviour around these machines
could, madam."
144,"437.23","440.13","A few years after that first
initial experience."
145,"439.88","443.79","I had with this baby dinosaur
robot do workshop with her friend"
146,"443.74","444.8","Hannah Scott."
147,"444.23","447","Scott, then we took five of these"
148,"446.68","449.89","baby dinosaur about we give them."
149,"449.76","451.04","The five teams of people."
150,"450.59","459.52","We had the name them and play with
them and them for about an hour."
151,"458.94","464.17","Then we unveiled a him or a
hatchet and we told them to"
152,"464.08","471.09","torture and kill the row and then
this turned out to be a little"
153,"470.7","475.29","more dramatic than we expected it
to be because none of the"
154,"475.16","477.27","participants wouldn't even so much
as straight."
155,"476.9","477.89","A robot."
156,"477.68","479.32","So we had to improvise."
157,"478.9","480.33","End at some point."
158,"480.2","481.08","He said o.k."
159,"480.75","483.22","You can save your team's robot."
160,"482.79","485.24","If you destroy another team throw."
161,"485.14","489.07","I And anyone that didn't work."
162,"488.8","490.06","They couldn't do it."
163,"489.81","492.1","So finally said, We're gonna
destroy all the robots are someone"
164,"492.01","497.67","takes a hatchet to one of them."
165,"497.42","499.13","This guy stood up and he took the"
166,"499.01","500.3","hatchet and the whole room,
Winston."
167,"500.12","504.36","See brother had to down on the
robot's neck and there was this"
168,"504.21","505.11","half joking."
169,"504.76","506.26","Is there reason to."
170,"505.76","510.84","For example, prevent the child
from kicking about Doc That just"
171,"510.51","514.6","out of respect for property
because the child may be more"
172,"514.23","518.21","likely to take a real dark and
again."
173,"517.94","522.16","It's not just kids and this is the
violent video games question, but"
174,"521.94","524","it's a completely new level
because of this visceral"
175,"523.72","527.05","physicality that we respond more
intensely."
176,"526.83","530.52","Two images on a screen, we behave
violently towards Robarts"
177,"530.09","533.99","specifically robots that are
designed to mimic life is is that"
178,"533.7","534.69","training cruelty muscles."
179,"534.52","598.49","The answer to this question has"
180,"598.27","601.62","the potential impact human
behaviour has the potential impact"
181,"601.3","603.51","social norms."
182,"603.2","605.53","It has the potential to inspire"
183,"604.8","606.93","rules around."
184,"606.83","608.28","What we can and can't do certain"
185,"608.07","612.38","Robarts animal cruelty, because
even if robots can't fuel our"
186,"611.72","616.53","behaviour towards a matter for us
and regardless of whether we end"
187,"616.43","621.74","up changing ovals robots might be
able to help us come to a new"
188,"621.03","623.23","understanding of ourselves."
189,"623.15","628.09","Most of what learned over the past"
190,"627.43","630.08","ten years have not been about
technology."
191,"629.95","643.48","A It's been about human psychology
and empathy and how we relate to"
192,"643.29","644.1","others."
193,"643.48","646.9","And because when a child is kind"
194,"646.61","647.96","to her room."
195,"647.5","650.87","But when a soldier tries to save a"
196,"650.37","652.26","robot on the battlefield."
197,"651.93","655.32","When a group of people refuses to"
198,"655","658.68","harm her about a baby dinosaur."
199,"658.42","662.25","Those robots aren't just motors in"
