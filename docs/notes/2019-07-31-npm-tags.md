# Npm tags

First make sure you have done a commit of latest changes then

>You can run `npm version 1.0.4-alpha.1` to update `package.json` and create a git tag in one go (see https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/version).

- [Publishing a beta or alpha version to NPM](https://medium.com/@kevinkreuzer/publishing-a-beta-or-alpha-version-to-npm-46035b630dd7)

this changes `package.json` version to be 

```json
 "version": "1.0.4-alpha.0",
```

then you can run  `npm run publish:public` which under the hood preps the files and folder and runs `npm publish dist --access public`.

To install in another repo

```
npm install @bbc/react-transcript-editor@alpha
```
